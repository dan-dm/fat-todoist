### About
`fat-todoist` is a simple CLI utility which recursively adds local *Folders-As-Tasks* in **Todoist**. Can optionally also add files as tasks with the `--files` flag.

### Preparation

- For one, you obviously need a Todoist account.
- You need your Todoist API key, you will find it near the bottom of [this](https://todoist.com/app/settings/integrations) page.

## Installation

```bash
//  install globally
npm install -g fat-todoist

//  use in any folder with the --api token flag
fat-todoist --api 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'

//  or, you can alternatively export the token to process.env & just run `fat-todoist` cmd
export TODOIST_API_KEY='xxxxxxxxxxxx'

//  you could also hardcode your token as TODOIST_API_KEY in './lib/fat-todoist.js' 
//  (might want to `npm rm -g` the package & re-install it)
let TODOIST_API_KEY = process.env.TODOIST_API_KEY || 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'

```
#### Good-to-know

- **By design**, the current folder's name is used as the name of the project in **Todoist**. This cannot be changed.
- **By default**, the parent project is 'Self-Improvement', but you can specify an alternate via the `--parent flag`, or have it be an empty string which will create projects directly in **Todoist** root.
- Also by default, just the folder/subfolder structure is cloned as tasks inside **Todoist**, this structure aligns well with *chapter/module based projects*.
    - An *include files* flag  ― `--files` is available in case needed (for example when adding a folder with eBooks to read as tasks in Todoist)
    - Do note that folders with a large number of files will take quite a long time to process, AND also keep in mind that you might hit the API maximums (currently [300 tasks per project](https://todoist.com/pricing#:~:text=Active%20tasks%20per%20project)). There's not much to do about that!

### Disclaimer: 

This project is not an official **Todoist** integration. ie: this functionality was missing, so I added it. Magic!✨

Made with JS, node and ❤. **Todoist** [is just awesome](https://todoist.com/).
